# Build/Flash Verification Evidence Report

## Scope
- Verify what is built, flashed, running on E84 hardware, or host-only.
- No APS logic, GUI/LCD behavior, predictor behavior, or controller/safety behavior was changed for this report.
- The portable APS modules are now embedded linked in `proj_cm55`, and the one-shot boot probe runtime-verified the predictor/controller/safety path on hardware.
- Current repo state at capture time:
  - Branch: `embedded-bringup-smoke-test`
  - Commit: `11f430ded92c0127f72c52ff7d69dbdceb75ff42`
- Recovery closure:
- Physical LCD confirmed recovered after clean rebuild and default probe-free flash.
- Default image must not print `APS probe:`.
- A clean rebuild is required after toggling `APP_APS_EMBEDDED_PROBE`.
- UART boot alone is not enough to claim LCD success.

## Update 2026-06-12 17:00 PDT
- Flashed merged `main` commit `39f6361` with the Candidate V1 tables included.
- Pre-reset OpenOCD again detected `PSE846GPS2DBZC4A` and reported `CYBOOT_SUCCESS`.
- Post-reset OpenOCD completed a clean `reset run` after programming.
- UART after the flash showed the legacy LVGL demo boot banner and did not show any `APS probe:` line or smoke sequence output.
- The panel was not directly visible in this terminal session, so the run records UART and debugger evidence only.

## Verification Matrix

| System Item | Host Tested | Embedded Built | Flashed | Running on Hardware | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| E84 LCD/GUI baseline | no | yes | yes | yes | `make build ...`, `make program ...`, OpenOCD reset-run, UART banner | GUI image stayed alive after flash/reset; no fresh photo was taken in this session. |
| Flash recovery/reset workflow | no | no | no | yes | OpenOCD `init; flash banks; reset run; sleep 2000; shutdown` | Target reported `PSE846GPS2DBZC4A` and `Boot Status : CYBOOT_SUCCESS`. |
| Host APS simulation | yes | no | no | no | `make -f host.mk test`, `make -f host.mk regression` | Host-only APS framework and simulator. |
| Regression fixtures | yes | no | no | no | fixture/gold output from `make -f host.mk regression` | Both fixture and gold matrices passed. |
| IOB engine | yes | yes | yes | no | host test output (`PASS: iob ...`), CM55 link map | Embedded linked, not runtime called. |
| COB engine | yes | yes | yes | no | host test output (`PASS: cob ...`), CM55 link map | Embedded linked, not runtime called. |
| Activity engine | yes | yes | yes | no | host test output (`PASS: activity ...`), CM55 link map | Embedded linked, not runtime called. |
| Controller/safety framework | yes | yes | yes | yes | host test output (`PASS: controller ...`, `PASS: safety ...`), CM55 probe output | Embedded linked, one-shot runtime verified. |
| Audit logging | yes | yes | yes | no | fixture/audit CSV outputs, CM55 link map | Embedded linked, not runtime called. |
| Embedded APS one-shot runtime probe | yes | yes | yes | yes | `make build ...`, `make program ...`, OpenOCD reset-run, UART `APS probe:` line | One-shot probe ran on boot and returned to the existing GUI/LVGL flow; later recovery showed why boot-time APS work must stay off the default image. |

### Embedded APS one-shot runtime probe
- Source files involved:
  - `proj_cm55/main.c`
  - `proj_cm55/app/EdgeAI_Insulin_Pump_Infineon_E8_Eval_Kit/edgeai_insulin_pump_app.c`
  - `proj_cm55/app/EdgeAI_Insulin_Pump_Infineon_E8_Eval_Kit/edgeai_insulin_pump_app.h`
  - `firmware/src/predictor_v2.c`
  - `firmware/src/controller_openaps.c`
  - `firmware/src/safety_supervisor.c`
- Build target:
  - `proj_cm55`
- Commands used:
  - `make build TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM CONFIG_DISPLAY=W4P3INCH_DISP DEFINES+=APP_APS_EMBEDDED_PROBE=1 -j8`
  - `make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM CONFIG_DISPLAY=W4P3INCH_DISP DEFINES+=APP_APS_EMBEDDED_PROBE=1`
  - OpenOCD reset-run: `init; flash banks; reset run; sleep 2500; shutdown`
- Runtime call path:
  - `main()` prints the boot banner, then calls `ApsEmbeddedProbe_RunOnce()`, which calls `PredictorV2_Reset()`, `PredictorV2_SetEnabled(true)`, `OpenApsController_Reset()`, `PredictorV2_Update(...)`, `OpenApsController_DetermineBasal(...)`, and `SafetySupervisor_Apply(...)` once.
- UART evidence:
  - `APS probe: BG=120 P15=125 P30=126 P60=127 ACTION=NO_CHANGE SAFETY=0x00000000 OK=111`
- LCD / GUI evidence:
  - LCD stayed alive after flash and reset-run; GUI remained on the baseline demo.
- Probe execution:
  - Single-reset capture shows one `APS probe:` line; the earlier program step also produced a normal boot, which is why the combined capture showed one line per boot.

  - `embedded-bringup-smoke-test`

### LCD / probe recovery closure
- Bad commit:
  - `3fdd51a`
- Last LCD-good commit before probe:
  - `cbe7b58`
- Recovery branch:
  - `recover-lcd-after-aps-probe`
- Symptom:
  - LCD blank after probe-enabled image and stale artifact reuse during the first baseline flash attempt.
- Cause hypothesis:
  - Stale probe-enabled build artifacts and the risk of running APS work too early from `main()`.
- Recovery action:
  - Tightened `APP_APS_EMBEDDED_PROBE == 1` gating.
  - Ran `make clean` with the documented ModusToolbox environment.
  - Rebuilt the default image from scratch.
  - Reflashed and ran OpenOCD `reset run`.
  - Physically confirmed the LCD recovered after the clean rebuild and probe-free flash.
- New rule:
  - No APS runtime call from boot or `main()` until a LCD-safe delayed or sidecar execution model is designed.
  - Clean rebuild is required after toggling `APP_APS_EMBEDDED_PROBE`.
  - Physical LCD verification is required before claiming success.

### Embedded GUI files

|---|---|---|

## Remaining Gaps
- No fresh LCD photo was captured during this evidence pass.
- Only the one-shot boot probe is runtime verified on hardware; the rest of the APS framework remains link-only.
- The verification evidence is complete for the current board/repo state, but it does not claim broader embedded APS loop behavior on hardware.

## Phase 15 Focus
1. HUD simplification and cleanup.
2. Visual-fire realism stabilization and freeze-proofing.
3. Repository and docs hygiene.
4. Flash/recovery safety hardening.
5. Strategic non-repeating attacker release sequencing + top debug-stage instrumentation.

## Phase 16 Preview
- Ambient city layer.
- Sirens tied to threat pressure.
- Drone flight audio cues.
- Explosion and CIWS burst audio cues.
- Mix priority/ducking.

## Priority Fix List (2026-04-08)
1. Investigate and fix intermittent gameplay freeze (top blocker):
   - freeze remains reproducible during gameplay despite prior hardening passes,
   - action focus: isolate state/path transition that still produces lockup.
2. Keep tracking boxes disabled until re-enabled by explicit request:
   - lock-box render path is now hard-disabled (`lock_on=0`),
   - attacker sprites remain visible.
3. Enforce flash artifact freshness every cycle:
   - always regenerate `proj_cm55.hex`/`proj_cm55.bin` from latest ELF before flashing,
   - stale CM55 hex can otherwise replay older runtime behavior on hardware.
4. Soak-validate hunter icon stability (recently patched):
   - `Pelican`, `TYTAN`, and `Merops` deck icons now use forced per-refresh foreground + style synchronization,
   - run extended gameplay to confirm no further icon blink/regression.
5. Soak-validate fireball + city-fire rendering (recently patched):
   - fireballs are re-enabled and forced foreground at impact,
   - city-fire rendering is re-enabled with lightweight animated frames in safe-mode path.
6. Replace pong speaker-test audio with full gameplay soundscape:
   - explosions, city ambience, firetrucks, ambulances, drone sounds, emergency escalation,
   - event-driven mapping and timing aligned with gameplay states.
7. Improve `ALGO` gameplay logic on attacker and defender for stronger strategy and more fun.
8. Add settings file and help file with user-facing guidance and controls reference.
9. Redraw flame visuals (detailed redraw scope to be defined when this step starts).
10. Add subtle city liveliness lighting:
   - tiny white/tungsten ground-level flickers across city footprint,
   - flicker sprite size target: `1px` to `3px` squares,
   - low-intensity, randomized timing/placement to avoid visual noise.

## Plan For #1 (Audio Overhaul)
1. Audio asset inventory pass:
   - scan current `sounds/` library,
   - map self-descriptive file names to event categories (`ambient_city`, `drone_flight`, `explosion`, `ciws`, `siren`, `firetruck`, `ambulance`, `ui`).
2. Event-to-sound mapping table:
   - create a single source-of-truth table in code for trigger event, preferred clip set, volume, cooldown, and loop/one-shot behavior.
3. Timing and layering model:
   - define per-channel priorities and max concurrency,
   - set ducking rules (for example: explosion/CIWS briefly duck ambience, sustained emergency can ride over ambience),
   - set anti-spam cooldowns for rapid repeated events.
4. Game-state audio director:
   - idle/normal combat/high-threat/breach/emergency states,
   - escalate siren + emergency vehicle layers with city damage/threat pressure.
5. Runtime integration:
   - hook triggers into attacker launch, intercept, leak, city-hit, CIWS burst, and phase transition points.
6. Tuning and validation:
   - run long gameplay soaks,
   - verify no clipping, no starvation, and no event/audio desync,
   - freeze current audio baseline as the next restore-point candidate.

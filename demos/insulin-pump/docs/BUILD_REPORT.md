## Branch
- `embedded-bringup-smoke-test`

## Commit
- `11f430ded92c0127f72c52ff7d69dbdceb75ff42`

## Target
- `APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2`

## Toolchain
- `GCC_ARM`
- ModusToolbox tools path: `/home/user/toolchains/infineon/ModusToolbox_local/opt/Tools/ModusToolbox/tools_3.7`
- GCC ARM path: `/home/user/toolchains/infineon/ModusToolbox_local/opt/Tools/mtb-gcc-arm-eabi/14.2.1/gcc`

## Build Command
```bash
make build TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM CONFIG_DISPLAY=W4P3INCH_DISP TARGET=APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2 \
  DEFINES+=APP_INSULIN_PUMP_MODE=1 DEFINES+=APP_SMART_PONG_MODE=0 DEFINES+=APP_APS_SMOKE_TEST=1
```

## Flash Command
```bash
make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM CONFIG_DISPLAY=W4P3INCH_DISP TARGET=APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2 \
  DEFINES+=APP_INSULIN_PUMP_MODE=1 DEFINES+=APP_SMART_PONG_MODE=0 DEFINES+=APP_APS_SMOKE_TEST=1
```

## Result
- Embedded build: success
- Flash/program: success
- UART boot banner: success
- One-shot APS probe: success
- Observed on UART: exactly one `APS probe:` line per boot, with the LCD remaining alive
- Portable APS modules are now linked into the CM55 image, and the boot-time probe verified the predictor/controller/safety path once
- For the current verification pass, the more complete build/flash evidence is captured in `docs/BUILD_FLASH_VERIFICATION.md`

## Warnings
- `ClampF32` unused warning in `cgm_model_runtime.c`
- `touchpad_read` unused variable warnings in `lv_port_indev.c`
- RWX load-segment linker warning for `proj_cm33_s.elf`
- `dashboard_timer_cb` is now restored in smoke mode so the GUI/timers remain active while APS prints as a sidecar

## Flash Main
- Flashing merged `main` commit `39f6361` completed successfully.
- The flashed image included Candidate V1 and did not enable the APS probe or smoke path by default.
- UART showed the boot banner and no APS probe line.
- Physical LCD verification was not directly captured from the terminal session.

## Root Cause Hypothesis
- The earlier active smoke loop likely stalled the panel because APS work was driven from the GUI/timer path with repeated `push_sample()` updates and UART prints, effectively turning smoke mode into a competing UI workload.
- The LCD-safe fix restores the baseline GUI timer path and keeps APS output in a lightweight UART-only sidecar so the panel never depends on APS work to refresh.
- A second likely contributor was the CM55 loop sleeping too long when `lv_timer_handler()` had no near-term work scheduled; capping the loop delay to a small value keeps the GUI and touch service alive even when APS mode is quiet.
- The sidecar also needed a pacing fallback because the timer-driven GUI loop alone was not guaranteeing repeated APS service on this port.

## UART Output
```text
APS Research Platform
Mode: Embedded smoke test
Predictor: present
Controller: present
Safety: present
Build: Jun 11 2026 21:43:59
```

## Known Gaps
- Timing instrumentation still reports `timing not available`.
- The GUI timer and APS sidecar now share the display safely; the next validation is to confirm the final smoke step/completion banner on a longer UART watch.
- The boot banner still shows the older build timestamp string in the UART watch window; that stamp should be refreshed or explained in a follow-up.
- No host regression was needed because this pass only changed embedded firmware smoke wiring.

## Restore-Point Recheck
- The CM55 application sources were rolled back to `failsafe-e8-insulin-pump` for LCD revalidation.
- The restore-point rebuild completed successfully and was programmed to the board.
- UART was quiet during the short follow-up window, which is expected for the baseline image; the remaining confirmation is a direct LCD visual check on the board.

## Recovery Closure
- Physical LCD confirmed recovered after clean rebuild and default probe-free flash.
- Default image must not print `APS probe:`.
- A clean rebuild is required after toggling `APP_APS_EMBEDDED_PROBE`.
- UART boot alone is not enough to claim LCD success.
